## Things to learn

- Working of `Row`, `Column`, `Box` widgets
- Applying `Modifier`s to different widgets to customise their look and feel
- Working with `ViewModel` in compose
- Working with `mutableStateOf` state management DSL, and the fact that this will rebuid the entire UI automatically when the state you give it changes
- Having a clean architecture, organising into the MVVM pattern
